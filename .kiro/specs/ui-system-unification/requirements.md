# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Pommai platform currently suffers from inconsistent UI implementation due to two competing component systems: a custom @pommai/ui library with RetroUI pixel art styling and standard shadcn/ui components. This creates visual inconsistency, duplicated CSS, developer confusion, and conflicts between retroui.css and Tailwind CSS. The goal is to unify the entire platform under a single, cohesive RetroUI design system that maintains the clean, modern retro aesthetic seen in the auth pages.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working on Pommai, I want a single, unified UI component system, so that I can build features without confusion about which components to use and ensure visual consistency across the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer needs a UI component THEN they SHALL have access to only one implementation per component type
2. WHEN importing components THEN the system SHALL provide consistent import paths from a single source
3. WHEN building new features THEN all components SHALL follow the RetroUI pixel art aesthetic
4. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN there SHALL be no duplicate component implementations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user of the Pommai platform, I want a consistent visual experience across all pages, so that the interface feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating between different sections THEN all UI components SHALL maintain consistent RetroUI styling
2. WHEN interacting with buttons, cards, inputs, and other elements THEN they SHALL all follow the same pixel art design language
3. WHEN viewing any page THEN the typography SHALL use the established font hierarchy (3 different text fonts as seen in auth pages)
4. WHEN using the platform THEN all components SHALL have consistent spacing, colors, and visual effects

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the Pommai codebase, I want all shadcn/ui components converted to RetroUI styling, so that we eliminate CSS conflicts and maintain design consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a shadcn/ui component exists THEN it SHALL be converted to use RetroUI pixel art styling
2. WHEN components use Radix UI primitives THEN they SHALL be wrapped with RetroUI visual styling
3. WHEN CSS is applied THEN there SHALL be no conflicts between retroui.css and standard Tailwind classes
4. WHEN components are styled THEN they SHALL use CSS custom properties for theming consistency

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working with the component library, I want consistent APIs across all components, so that I can use them predictably and efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using any component THEN it SHALL accept standard React props and ref forwarding
2. WHEN components have variants THEN they SHALL use consistent prop naming conventions
3. WHEN components need customization THEN they SHALL support CSS custom properties for theming
4. WHEN importing components THEN they SHALL be available from @pommai/ui with TypeScript support

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer building new features, I want comprehensive RetroUI components for all common UI patterns, so that I can implement designs without creating custom solutions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building forms THEN I SHALL have access to RetroUI-styled form components (inputs, selects, checkboxes, etc.)
2. WHEN creating layouts THEN I SHALL have access to RetroUI-styled layout components (cards, dialogs, sheets, etc.)
3. WHEN adding navigation THEN I SHALL have access to RetroUI-styled navigation components (dropdowns, tabs, etc.)
4. WHEN displaying data THEN I SHALL have access to RetroUI-styled data components (tables, lists, badges, etc.)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer working on the platform, I want clear migration paths from the current mixed system, so that I can systematically update existing code without breaking functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating existing components THEN the new components SHALL maintain the same API surface where possible
2. WHEN updating imports THEN the system SHALL provide clear mapping from old to new component paths
3. WHEN testing migrated components THEN they SHALL maintain existing functionality while gaining RetroUI styling
4. WHEN deploying changes THEN the migration SHALL be done incrementally to minimize risk
