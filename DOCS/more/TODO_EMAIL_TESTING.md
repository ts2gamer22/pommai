# üìß Email Verification Testing & Domain Setup TODO

## üöÄ Quick Test (Before Domain Purchase)

### ‚úÖ DEPLOYMENT SUCCESSFUL!
- Convex deployment complete with Resend component
- Email verification is now REQUIRED for login
- Password reset functionality is configured
- Welcome emails after verification are set up

### For Development Testing (Using Resend's Test Email)
1. **Current Setup:**
   - Using Convex Resend component (proper integration)
   - Test mode enabled for development (delivered@resend.dev)
   - Production will use your verified domain

2. **To Test Right Now:**
   ```bash
   # ‚úÖ Already deployed to Convex production!
   
   # Make sure these are set in Convex Dashboard:
   RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here  # ‚úÖ Already set
   RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret  # Optional for webhooks
   BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your_secret_here  # ‚úÖ Already set
   SITE_URL=https://your-app-url.vercel.app (or localhost:3000 for local)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://warmhearted-snail-998.convex.cloud  # ‚úÖ Set
   ```

3. **Test Flow:**
   - Sign up with YOUR email (must be verified in Resend dashboard)
   - Check inbox for verification email
   - Click verification link
   - Try logging in without verification (should fail)
   - Complete verification and try again (should work)
   - Test password reset flow

## üìã Production Setup TODO (After Domain Purchase)

### 1. Domain Configuration
- [ ] Purchase domain (e.g., pommai.com)
- [ ] Add domain to Resend dashboard
- [ ] Add DNS records from Resend to your domain provider:
  - SPF record
  - DKIM records
  - Optional: DMARC record
- [ ] Verify domain in Resend
- [ ] Update `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` in Convex to `noreply@yourdomain.com`

### 2. Email Templates Enhancement
- [ ] Add your logo to email templates
- [ ] Update support email address
- [ ] Add unsubscribe links for marketing emails
- [ ] Test emails on different clients (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail)

### 3. Security Enhancements
- [x] Email verification required ‚úÖ
- [x] Password reset with expiration ‚úÖ
- [x] Minimum password requirements ‚úÖ
- [x] Convex Resend component with rate limiting ‚úÖ (built-in)
- [x] Email queuing and retry logic ‚úÖ (built-in with Convex Resend)
- [ ] Add email verification audit logs
- [ ] Implement account lockout after failed attempts
- [ ] Add 2FA support (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Add CAPTCHA for signup (prevent bot signups)

### 4. Monitoring & Analytics
- [ ] Set up Resend webhooks for:
  - Email delivered
  - Email bounced
  - Email complained (spam)
- [ ] Create dashboard for email metrics
- [ ] Set up alerts for failed email sends

## üîí Additional Security TODOs

## üö® Known Issues to Fix
1. Email templates need actual logo URLs
2. FROM email needs to be changed from `delivered@resend.dev` (test mode)
3. Support email needs to be configured
4. ~~Rate limiting not yet implemented~~ ‚úÖ Built into Convex Resend component
5. TypeScript errors in agents.ts and other files need fixing

## üìù Notes
- Current setup uses Resend's test email for development
- All security features are enabled except rate limiting
- Email templates are responsive and look great
- Remember to test with different email providers

## üéØ Priority Order
1. Deploy and test with current setup
2. Purchase and verify domain
3. Implement rate limiting
4. Add audit logging
5. Add 2FA support
6. Implement remaining security features
