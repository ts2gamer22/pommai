## Implementation Details

### WebSocket Protocol
```python
# Message format
{
    "type": "audio_chunk" | "control" | "handshake" | "ping",
    "payload": {
        "data": "hex_encoded_audio",
        "metadata": {
            "isFinal": bool,
            "format": "opus",
            "sampleRate": 16000
        }
    },
    "timestamp": float
}
```

### Connection Flow
1. **Initialize** → Create FastRTCConfig
2. **Connect** → WebSocket connection with auth headers
3. **Handshake** → Send device capabilities
4. **Stream** → Send/receive audio chunks
5. **Heartbeat** → Maintain connection alive
6. **Reconnect** → Automatic on failure

### Audio Flow
1. **Button Press** → Start recording
2. **Capture** → Read from microphone
3. **Compress** → Opus encoding
4. **Stream** → Send chunks to gateway
5. **Button Release** → Send final chunk
6. **Receive** → Get response audio
7. **Decode** → Opus decoding
8. **Play** → Output to speaker

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# FastRTC Gateway
FASTRTC_GATEWAY_URL=ws://localhost:8080/ws

# Device Identity
DEVICE_ID=rpi-toy-001
TOY_ID=default-toy
AUTH_TOKEN=your-auth-token

# Features
ENABLE_WAKE_WORD=false
ENABLE_OFFLINE_MODE=true
```

### FastRTC Config Options
```python
FastRTCConfig(
    gateway_url: str,        # WebSocket URL
    device_id: str,          # Unique device identifier
    toy_id: str,             # Selected toy ID
    auth_token: str,         # Optional authentication
    reconnect_attempts: int, # Max retry attempts (default: 5)
    reconnect_delay: float,  # Initial retry delay (default: 2.0)
    ping_interval: int,      # WebSocket ping interval (default: 20)
    ping_timeout: int,       # Ping timeout (default: 10)
    audio_format: str,       # Audio format (default: "opus")
    sample_rate: int         # Sample rate (default: 16000)
)
```

## Testing

### Run Tests
```bash
cd apps/raspberry-pi
pytest tests/test_fastrtc.py -v
```

```bash
# Test connection standalone
cd apps/raspberry-pi/src
python fastrtc_connection.py

# Run updated client
python pommai_client_fastrtc.py
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Memory Usage
- FastRTC connection: ~5MB

   pip install -r apps/raspberry-pi/requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Update Config**:
   ```bash
   # Edit .env file
