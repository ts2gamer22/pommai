i finally got access to the raspberry pia via ssh, is there anythgin i should be careful about?
Great! Now that you can SSH in, here are the key things to do and watch out for.

Immediate security and stability
•  Change passwords now
•  root and dietpi users
•  Use long, unique passwords
•  Command:
bash
•  Move to SSH keys, then disable password logins
•  On Windows (PowerShell):
pwsh
•  On the Pi, disable SSH password logins:
◦  dietpi-config → Security Options → SSH server: disable password auth (or switch to OpenSSH if you prefer)
•  Update DietPi and packages
•  ```bash path=null start=null
    dietpi-update
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
•  Consider dietpi-backup for quick system snapshots:
bash
Networking and access
•  You’re currently in USB host mode (keyboard works). If you later want single-cable USB networking from PC:
•  Switch back to gadget mode (tell me and I’ll flip:
◦  config.txt → dtoverlay=dwc2,dr_mode=peripheral
◦  cmdline.txt → … rootwait modules-load=dwc2,g_ether …
•  On Windows, set the USB/RNDIS adapter IPv4 to 192.168.7.1 and SSH to 192.168.7.2
•  Optional: make WiFi static
•  dietpi-config → Network Options → set a static IP if you want the Pi to always be at the same address

System setup quality-of-life
•  Localisation/timezone
•  dietpi-config → Localisation → set timezone/keyboard/locale
•  Automatic updates
•  You have “check-only” enabled (safe). If you want auto-upgrade:
◦  dietpi-config → Security Options → Unattended APT upgrades (or set CONFIG_CHECK_APT_UPDATES=2 later)
•  Services and logs
•  Dropbear status:
bash
•  DietPi uses RAMlog by default; great for SD card longevity. If you run heavy logging services, consider Rsyslog+Logrotate via dietpi-software.

If anything looks off (e.g., WiFi drops, USB gadgets, under-voltage warnings), tell me what you see from:
bash
and I’ll help you tune it.

Want me to switch you back to USB gadget mode later or lock down SSH password logins for you now?
