# EVERY CODING AGENT WORKING ON A PHASE SHOULD GO DO DOCS FOLDER IN ROOT, DOCS/PHASE/ ANALYSE THEIR PHASE.md file and then go to DOCS/CONTEXT/phasexcontext/ analyse the docs they need to add more context to help them code! ALWAYS ULTRATHINK AND CODE!

# ANALYSE PLAN.MD FOR DETAILED INFO ABOUT THE CODEBASE!

# WHEN YOU A MCP FAILS, OR YOU DON'T HAVE CONTEXT, STOP CODING AND TELL ASK THE USER TO GIVE CONTEXT OR FIX THE MCP!
USE CONTEXT7 MCP FOR DOCS 
AND SEQUENTIAL THINKING MCP FOR PLANNING 
# NEVER RECREATE A FILE WITHOUT NOTIFYING THE USER!

# ADD COMMENTS IN JSDOC FORMAT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE!

# CREATE COMPONENETS IN THE COMPONENET FOLDER WHEN YOU NEED TO! 

EXAMPLE IF YOU ARE WORKING ON A NEW PAGE, MAKE SURE TO CREATE A newpage folder inside the componenet folder and then create .tsx files for each componenet.

# NEVER CROSS OVER 500 LINES OF CODE IN A FILE! 

# USE AIRBNB FORMAT FOR STYLING! 

# WHENEVER YOU CREATE A NEW FILE OR STRUCTURE, UPDATE THE projectstructure.md
# projectstructure.md has the file tree of the codebase.

# USE JEST FOR TESTING
# USE WINSTON FOR LOGGING
